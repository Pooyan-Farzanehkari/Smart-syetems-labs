    "### The pendulum dynamic is described here by considering gravitational torque,Motor torque, air friction, mechanical(joint of the pandelum and cart) friction, and pendulum length:\n",
    "### Gravitational torque: which is the force exerted by gravity that causes the pendulum to swing back and forth. This torque depends on the mass of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "### Motor torque: this forced is frist applied to the cart and then cart transfer that  to the pendulum. The force is the dependet on several factors that will be mentioned later. here the forced is depended on the acce of the joint point of the cart and pendulum.\n",
    "### Air friction: As the pendulum moves through the air, it encounters resistance that slows down its motion. This frictional force is proportional to the speed of the pendulum and acts in the opposite direction of its movement.\n",
    "### Mechanical friction: is also a significant factor in pendulum dynamics. This type of friction occurs at the pivot point where the pendulum is attached. It results from the contact between moving parts and can cause energy loss, leading to a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the pendulum's oscillations over time.\n",
    "### length of the pendulum: plays a crucial role in its dynamics. The length determines the period of the pendulum, which is the time it takes to complete one full swing. A longer pendulum will have a longer period, meaning it swings more slowly, while a shorter pendulum will have a shorter period and swing more quickly.\n"
