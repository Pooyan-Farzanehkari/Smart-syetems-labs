    "now lets discuss question 3.4 and go step by step\n",
    "fist of all, population size:\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger population size increases the genetic diversity among individuals in each generation, which can lead to better exploration of the solution space. For this reason, we selected a population size of 60. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational time. In an ideal scenario, even a population size as small as 4 was able to achieve a partial solution when the generation size exceeded 4. However, the result was limitedâ€”it only reached 180 degrees and was unable to maintain stability at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutation rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutation introduces random and unpredictable variations into the population, allowing the algorithm to explore areas of the solution space that may not be reachable through crossover alone. If the mutation rate is too low, the algorithm may converge prematurely and become trapped in local optima. Conversely, if the mutation rate is too high, the search process becomes overly random, which can prevent convergence to a viable solution. In our implementation, we set the mutation rate to 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross over rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "The crossover rate determines how frequently two parent sequences combine to produce offspring. Common values typically range between 80% and 90%, as higher crossover rates facilitate the exchange of beneficial traits between solutions, promoting convergence. In our experiments, we began with short crossover intervals (e.g., every 2 steps) and gradually tested longer intervals to assess their impact on performance."

    "### 3.5.3 Bonus question: What is fundamentally the problem with the current crossover function in the GA? Can you come up with a better version?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using one-point crossover, we can employ uniform crossover, which offers several advantages. One-point crossover is computationally simple and efficient, but it limits genetic diversity by mixing genetic material at only a single location. This often results in offspring that closely resemble one parent, potentially slowing the learning process and increasing the risk of convergence to local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, uniform crossover enhances genetic diversity by randomly selecting each gene (or action) from either parent, thereby promoting broader exploration of the solution space and often leading to faster learning. However, this approach may occasionally disrupt beneficial sequences of genes inherited from parents, which could result in less stable behavior in offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while one-point crossover provides more consistency, uniform crossover generally yields better performance due to its greater variability and flexibility."
